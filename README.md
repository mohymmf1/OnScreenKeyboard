On Screen Keyboard
==================

The Problem
-----------
On screen keyboards are the bane of DVR users. To help alleviate the pain, one local company is asking you to implement part of a voice to text search for their DVR by developing an algorithm to script the on screen keyboard.
The keyboard is laid out as follows:

```
ABCDEF
GHIJKL
MNOPQR
STUVWX
YZ1234
567890
qwe343
```

Please write a program which scripts the path of the cursor on the keyboard. The program should: 

1. Accept a flat file as input.
	1. Each new line will contain a search term
2. Output the path for the DVR to execute for each line
	1. Assume the cursor will always start on the A
	2. Use the following characters to make up the path
		1. U = up
		2. D = down
		3. L = left
		4. R = right
		5. S = space
		6. \# = select
3.	Comma delimit the result
